## Mag Map!

I love to travel around the world, and everytime I go, I buy a local magnet.
But I had a problem that there is no space to display the magnets on fridge, and I can't afford to buy another fridge of course.
I just give up displaying them, and I was afraid that I forget where I bought them.

To solve my problem, I created this App.
Mag Map! enebles you to display the magnets with the location in the map, so that you can see where you bought each magnets as well enjoying the magnets display.

Mag Map is running at Heroku.
